/**
 * Interface to be implemented by mappable validators.<br>The validator is the central point of the validation
 * framework. It implements the whole chain of validation, from the triggers, till the display of the feedback.<br>Upon
 * validation trigger (for example, whenever the user enters some data in a field, presses an Apply button, etc.), data
 * is retrieved (for example, from the input field, a database, etc.) and passed to the validation algorithm (for
 * example, expecting data to be entered in a specific format), which produces validation results (for example, invalid
 * input, valid input, input too long, misspelled, etc.), which are then used to give appropriate feedback to the user
 * (for example, a popup dialog, an error icon, etc.).<br>A mappable validator allows to map triggers to data providers,
 * data providers to rules, and results to result handlers.<br>It can be used, for example, to build validation of a
 * group of components.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of trigger initiating the validation.
 * @param <P> Type of data provider providing the input data to be validated.
 * @param <U> Type of validation rules to be used on the input data.
 * @param <R> Type of validation results produced by the validation rules.
 * @param <H> Type of result handlers to be used on validation output.
