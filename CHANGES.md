## Backward incompatibilities in terms of behavior

In this release, the `dispose()` methods of the triggers, data providers, rules, result handlers, validators,
transformers and properties have been harmonized with the following principles:

* Objects referring to other objects should typically clear their references: this idea is that disposed objects should
not prevent garbage collection of other objects. This is typically handy and needed for objects having listeners (e.g.
triggers and readable properties), referring to GUI components (such as the properties from the
validationframework-swing module) or wrapping other objects (e.g. NegateBooleanPropertyWrapper and
ReadOnlyPropertyWrapper).
* Objects acting as wrappers around other objects (e.g. NegateBooleanPropertyWrapper and ReadOnlyPropertyWrapper) may
optionally dispose the wrapped objects. This gives better control over what needs to be disposed and when. For that
purpose, the `DeepDisposable` interface has been introduced.

This means that you probably need to verify all the places where you call or override the `dispose()` method and check
what you do with the disposed objects afterwards.

In particular, you should check:
* What the `dispose()` method should actually do: should it dispose other (referenced) objects as well? Should the other
objects be disposed manually?
* Whether you use the disposed objects: disposed objects cannot be re-used and calling their methods leads to
unspecified behavior, which may differ in other versions of the framework.
* Where you override the `dispose()` method: should `super.dispose()` be called as well?
* Where you implemented the `Disposable` interface: should the `DeepDisposable` interface also be implemented? Should a
deep or shallow disposed be done? Should it be configurable?

For example, the `dispose()` method of properties relating to Swing components now removes all references to these
components. So calling the `getComponent()` method of these properties after disposal will return `null`.

Furthermore, some classes now implement the `DeepDisposable`. This is typically the case for wrapper classes (e.g.
NegateBooleanPropertyWrapper class with wraps a ReadableProperty<Boolean>). Some of the `DeepDisposable` classes dispose
the wrapped objects by default. So you may want to check whether it does not dispose too much (depending on your
use-case). You may then call there `setDeepDispose()` method to reach the desired behavior.
